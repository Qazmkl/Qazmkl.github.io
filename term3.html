					In my third workterm, I returned to <a href="https://www.cooperators.ca/" target="_blank">The Co-operators</a> to work as an <strong>RPA Developer</strong> at their innovation team.<br/>
					<br/>
					This innovation team was based in an incubator in Kitchener. The main reason it was in a different location from Head Office was to seperate the team from normal company culture and process of working 
					(<strong>Waterfall</strong>) and experiment a new process of development (<strong>Agile</strong>) to see if this way of working can be more beneficial to the organization.<br/>
					<br/>
                    Unlike last time, I was working in a team made mostly of other co-ops. Most of the others were from different schools, had different levels of experinces and different 
					skill sets which was great because I get to see the different perspectives they all have. Overall, I enjoyed working and learning from all of them each and everyday.<br/>
                    <br/>
					In general, and compared my last workterms, I would say that my experience as an RPA developer felt more satisfying, was so much more exciting, and actually gave the sense that I was actually contributing something for the 
					organization.

														equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? That is when you can experience true

														This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything 
														to it yet. What the devil. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.

														That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've 
														known sorrow. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it 
														comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things.
